This is a local time to beat time converter for Layton URUG meeting.

1. clone this app to your local machine
2. bundle install.
   This has rspec tests and capybara for testing. I broke it somehow, so there
   are no passing tests :(
3. rake db:migrate <--sets up the databse.
4. We'll work on the main functionality of the app at our January meeting.
